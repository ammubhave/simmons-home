                <h4>Tours</h4>
                  <p>In recognition of the architectural significance of
                  Simmons Hall, we offer tours of the non-residential areas of the
                  building. A tour of Simmons Hall usually takes 45 to 75 minutes,
                  depending upon the interests of the tour group. The maximum tour
                  group size is 20 people, however, given enough notice, Simmons may
                  be able to arrange for additional guides to accommodate larger
                  groups.</p>

                  <p>There is a small fee charged for tours. This is sometimes waived,
                  as is the case for members of the MIT community, MIT alums and
                  special guests of MIT. For business-related tours, we ask for a
                  donation.</p>

                  <p>As our tour guides are students, we are unfortunately unable to offer tours outside of the regular academic calendar - including during the summer (May through August) or around the holidays (December through January). Please take this into account when submitting a tour request. We look forward to seeing you!</p>
