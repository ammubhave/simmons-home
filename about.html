                <p>Simmons has its own unique government structure. From our student led initiatives to our unique social "lounge" structure to our open house meetings and proposals, we have so much to get involved with.</p>

                <h4>Housemasters</h4>
                <p>The Housemaster team consists of <a
                href="mailto:emessig@mit.edu">John Essigmann</a>, Professor of
                Chemistry and Biological Engineering; <a
                href="mailto:emessig@mit.edu">Dr. Ellen Essigmann</a>; and <a
                href="mailto:srhall@mit.edu">Steven Hall</a>, Professor of
                Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>

                <p>The Housemasters manage and maintain social programs to connect
                students, GRTs, MIT faculty, and other community members. They
                provide academic and personal guidance to students to help them
                get the most out of their time at MIT. The Housemasters also
                manage the Residential Scholars Program at Simmons Hall.</p>

                <h4>Graduate Resident Tutors (GRTs)</h4>
                <p>GRTs, MITâ€™s equivalent of a Resident Assistant (RA), foster a
                living environment that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive of all
                community members. This responsibility includes encouraging
                personal growth, providing outlets for managing stress, and
                facilitating positive interpersonal relationships. GRTs are also
                responsible for implementing community standards, enhancing
                security, and promoting mutual respect among the residents. At
                Simmons Hall they can also be found flipping pancakes at the
                famous Simmons Hall Study Breaks and organizing floor-wide
                events.</p>

                <h4>Residential Scholars Program</h4>
                <p>The Founders Group of Simmons Hall envisioned a combined
                residential and multi-use environment in which the
                undergraduates of MIT could interact with other members of the
                community. Simmons includes many common spaces on the first
                floor that are intended to welcome our colleagues from across
                campus and our neighbors from Cambridge.</p>

                <p>The Residential Scholars program is meant to enrich MIT with
                new ideas and perspectives from people who are eager to share
                their wealth of life experiences. The program is composed of
                faculty members on sabbatical leave from other institutions,
                artists, industry professionals, and a limited number of MIT
                faculty members who have shown, by a long history of
                contributions to the community, a reason to participate in this
                program.</p>

                <p>The program is based in Simmons Hall but services the entire
                community.  The Scholars, working with the permanent House Team,
                typically run programs on Friday evenings. Since its inception
                in 2003, the financial resources to support the program
                primarily have been provided by the scholarly allowance
                associated with the William and Betsy Leitch Professorship,
                which is held by John Essigmann, one of the Housemasters of
                Simmons Hall. The community is indebted to the Leitchs for their
                generous support of this program.</p>
