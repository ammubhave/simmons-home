  <p> Contact the rooming assignment chairs (<a
  href="simmons-rooming@mit.edu">simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a>)
  for more information.</p>

  <h4>I. Temporary Freshmen Assignments</h4>

  <p>The Rooming Assignment Chairs (RACs) will
  receive the list of freshmen assigned to Simmons for REX in
  late June, along with the responses to a questionnaire they
  have all filled out listing some basic facts about
  themselves. Using this information, the RACs are charged with
  appropriately positioning these freshmen around the building
  as they see fit. No input from other upperclassmen is
  solicited or allowed, and special requests are only forwarded
  to the RACs from the Housing Department after proper
  vetting. Any roommate requests that are included from Housing
  must be honored. The RACs are also responsible for maintaining
  an up-to-date Welcome Letter to pass on to Housing. This
  assignment has no connection with or bearing on Final Freshmen
  Assignments.</p>

  <h4>II. Final Freshmen Assignments</h4> 

  <p>After REX and FYRE, Housing will send an updated
  roster of freshmen who will be assigned to Simmons for the
  school year. After a tour of the building and mingling with
  the various groups within Simmons, these freshmen will be
  given a preference sheet to fill out. Using the mindset that
  the collective happiness of the overall class is much more
  important than that of any individual freshman, final
  assignments are left to the discretion of the RACs and the
  results of the preference sheets. Requests for specific
  roommates are honored with the caveat that this is only true
  if the number of requested pairings is less than the number of
  doubles available. Any special requests (medical, religious,
  counseling, etc.) must be made through the Housing Department;
  no night-of special requests will be honored. Any verbal
  agreements with the RACs should be confirmed in writing (via
  an email to racs@simmons.mit.edu) prior to this
  process. Temporary Assignment has no bearing on Final
  Assignment - please do not ask for exceptions to this
  policy. The RACs try their best to account for all aspects of
  the preference sheet, but remember that they are only
  human. If there is a particular issue that a freshman feels
  particularly strongly about, it is highly recommended that
  they talk to the RACs in person about the issue, and use the
  flexibility of the preference sheet to denote such an
  issue. Any student that has been assigned to a room through
  this process may not squat their room during the internal
  spring lottery.</p>

  <h4> III. Transfer Student Assignments</h4>

  <p>Transfer students that are assigned to Simmons
  have two options. They may elect to participate in the
  Freshmen Preference Sheet Process, or the Transfer Student
  Preference Sheet Process. The Transfer Student Preference
  Sheet will be generated by the RACs prior to In House Rush,
  and distributed to anyone that is eligible and would like to
  use it. Priority in the Transfer Student Preference Sheet
  Process is determined by random number generation. Any student
  that has been assigned to a room through this process may not
  squat their room during the internal spring lottery.
  </p>

  <h4> IV. Waitlist, Readjustment Lottery and Summer Assignments Policy </h4>

  <p> Students who have elected to accept an offer
  from the Housing Department through the waitlist, the IAP
  readjustment lottery, or over the summer will be assigned to a
  room at the discretion of the RACs, with the guiding principle
  that the room assignments should be congruent with the
  incoming student's class year. Requests for specific rooms by these
  students will not be honored, but general room attributes they
  would like can be submitted to racs@simmons.mit.edu. Any
  student that has been assigned to a room through these
  processes may not squat their room during the internal spring
  lottery.
  </p>

  <h4> V. Internal Lotteries </h4>

  <p>Each semester after Registration Day, the RACs
  can elect to hold a Semester Readjustment Lottery. This
  lottery reallocates any rooms that have become vacant during
  the previous semester. Whether or not the lottery happens for
  a given semester is left at the discretion of the RACs based
  on available rooms and demand from the community. This lottery
  is open to all residents, but each student interested in
  entering the lottery must do so by emailing
  racs@simmons.mit.edu after the lottery has been announced.
  </p>
  <p>The order with which new room selection will take place will
  be done via one of two methods: a manual drawing, or a random
  number generation using the Spring Lottery script. Which
  method is used is left up to the RACs to decide based on the
  number of people entering. Priority within the lottery matches
  that of the Spring Lottery Policies. Freshmen who enter this
  lottery are not eligible to squat the room for the Spring
  Lottery.
  </p>
  <p>No sooner than the day after the order has been
  determined, the room selection process shall begin. On each
  student's turn, they can select an open room, or leave the
  lottery. If they select an open room, they are done, and their
  current room is added to the available rooms unless it is now
  a singly occupied double. Once available rooms or people run
  out, the lottery is over.
  </p>

  <h4> VI. Spring Lottery Policies </h4>

  <p>The Spring Lottery is conducted to allow
  residents to select their rooms for the upcoming school
  year. Once the final housing list is sent from the Housing
  Department, the RACs should prepare the spreadsheet, DB, and
  script for usage. Additionally, it is their job to inform
  residents with at least two weeks notice that the lottery will
  be taking place.
  </p>

  <p>After the announcement email from the RACs,
  residents can begin placing requests for blocking as well as
  room squats. RACs encourage residents to make these two
  requests as early as possible. Blocking and Squatting are
  defined in the Appendix. The last possible time to declare a
  block is midnight the day before the selection order
  lottery. Once this deadline passes, all blocks are final. The
  last possible time to declare a squat is before your room is
  chosen by another person. Obviously the RACs recommend doing
  so ahead of time to alleviate day-of stress for everyone, but
  it is not required. For completeness, if blocking causes a tie
  in the rankings, preference goes to the individual over the
  block, and smaller blocks over larger blocks.
  </p>

  <p>One week prior to the selection lottery, RACs
  will hold the selection order generation. This involves
  randomizing the order of each subsection of residents. The
  means by which the sections are randomized (script, papers
  drawn from a hat, etc.)  is at the discretion of the rooming
  chairs. However, all information about the process used must
  be public and take place at a public meeting announced to the
  dorm.  The ranked subsections are:
  </p>

  <ol>
  <li> Resident Seniors</li>
  <li> Transferring Seniors</li>
  <li> Resident 9th/10th Term</li>
  <li> Transferring 9th/10th Term</li>
  <li> Resident Juniors</li>
  <li> Transferring Juniors</li>
  <li> Resident Sophomores</li>
  <li> Transferring Sophomores</li>
  <li> Resident Freshmen</li>
  <li> Transferring Freshmen</li>
  </ol>

  <p>RACs are responsible for publishing this
  official order in a method that they see fit (DB, Google
  Spreadsheet, Posters in Dining, etc). Prior to and immediately
  after the script has been run, a record of the workspace and
  output should be created, and kept until the culmination of
  this overall process.</p>

  <p>On the room selection weekend, the RACs will
  proceed in order of the published rankings. Each student will
  be given one minute to select their room. If a student does
  not select a room in the period, or is not present at all,
  they will be dropped to the bottom of their group
  (i.e. Resident Seniors or Transferring Sophomores) and the
  RACs will move on to the next name on the list. At the end of
  each group, the RACs will announce the absent students. If the
  student again misses their turn, they will be dropped to the
  end of the lottery (i.e. after the transferring freshmen).</p>

  <p>The list of residents will be broken into blocks
  of fifty students, with one hour allocated to each block of
  fifty. A block of fifty may start after the allocated hour,
  but will not begin before that time.</p>

  <p>When a student's turn comes, he/she may pick any
  open room he wishes. If he/she selects a double, he/she may
  immediately designate a roommate. If he/she designates a
  roommate, the roommate is assigned to the room and removed
  from the lottery. If he/she does not choose a roommate, the
  slot remains open and will not be filled without the student's
  approval. If necessary, at the end of the lottery or during
  the Freshman Rooming Lottery, a student will be assigned to
  the open slot.</p>

  <p>If a resident is unable to attend the physical
  selection period, he may designate a proxy to choose
  instead. This proxy may be another student, who is given the
  power to choose a room for the resident, or the RACs. If the
  RACs are chosen to act as a proxy, the resident should submit
  a preference sheet, indicating the rooms/characteristics he
  would prefer. Anyone who declares a proxy must abide by the
  proxy's decision. Notification of intent to use a proxy must
  be emailed to the RACs <a href="mailto:simmons-rooming@mit.edu">
  simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a> no later than midnight the day
  before the room selection process.</p>

  <p>50 doubles are reserved for incoming
  freshmen. These rooms are distributed around the building
  during the lottery, with the constraint that at least 5
  doubles per GRT section are reserved. Once there are only 50
  doubles remaining, or 5 in a GRT section, squatting of those
  rooms is no longer allowed.</p>

  <p>After the lottery has been run and the final
  housing list has been received from the Housing Office,
  residents who desire to may swap rooms. These swaps must be
  approved by everyone involved, including roommates, and must
  be published to official and given 24 hours to clear. Any swap
  involving a resident who cancels his/her housing before
  move-in will be nullified and all residents returned to their
  original rooms. Room swaps for the fall semester are not
  conducted over the summer vacation. Therefore, students have
  until the last day of class (Spring Semester) to request a
  swap. After this, students wishing to swap rooms for the fall
  must wait until after Registration Day, fall semester.</p>

  <p>The RACs take no responsibility for maintaining
  or verifying bathroom gender preferences. If a resident has a
  strong aversion to sharing a bathroom with a given gender, it
  is that resident's responsibility to pick an appropriate
  room.</p>

  <p>In special circumstances, it may become
  necessary for RACs to assign a student to a specific
  room. These requests must come from counseling or medical and
  have been approved by the Simmons House Team. These requests
  do not need to be made public and are not open for
  discussion. Resolution of specific situations is left to the
  RACs and house team.</p>

  <h4> VII. Room Swaps </h4> 

  <p>Students may swap rooms during the Fall, IAP and
  Spring terms. Everyone involved in swap the including
  roommates any must email the RACs, <a
  href="simmons-rooming@mit.edu">simmons-rooming@mit.edu</a>, to
  confirm that they approve of the swap. Once the RACs have
  approval from everyone, they will notify the entire house body
  by emailing the official housing mailing list
  (official@simmons.mit.edu) to announce the proposed swap. Any
  resident then has twenty four hours to lodge any
  objections. These objections will be kept confidential, and if
  they are sufficient the swap will be refused. If there are no
  objections, the swap will go through and the students must
  move into their new rooms as soon as possible.</p>

  <h4> VIII. Special Circumstances </h4>

  <p>If students have conflicts or extenuating
  circumstances and need to move into a single or another room,
  the request must come from MIT Medical, MIT Counseling, or the
  Simmons House Team, comprised of the Simmons Housemasters,
  Associate Housemasters, and RLAD. No personal requests will be
  considered. Resolution of these issues is left to the house
  team and the RACs. Any student assigned to a room in this
  manner may not squat that room in the house-wide spring
  lottery.</p2>

  <h4> IX. Miscellaneous </h4>
  
  <p>Any situation not covered by this policy should
  be resolved at the discretion of the RACs, who are encouraged
  to amend the policy if this should happen.</p>

  <p>With the concurrence of the house team, any
  provision of this policy may be set aside at the discretion of
  the RACs. If possible, the RACs should identify and explain
  any such cases to the House Committee.</p>

  <p>Claiming early sophomore standing will not
  change one's class year for the purposes of housing
  preferences.</p>

  <h4> Appendix I</h4>

  <p>Blocking is the declaration that a group of
  people would like to be grouped together. The ranking of each
  member of a block is averaged, and the block is given that as
  their position. In case of ties, individuals have preference
  over small blocks which have preference over large
  blocks. When it becomes a block's turn, they pick in the order
  of their original rankings. All blocks must be declared by
  midnight the day before the script is run to randomize the
  lottery order. Once this script is run, a block is final. It
  is not possible to exit a block by squatting.</p>

  <p>Squatting is the declaration that a person will
  be keeping their current assignment. There are a number of
  restrictions on who can squat, so residents should be sure to
  read through all portions of the document that pertain to
  them. If a resident squats, they are ineligible to block. If a
  resident blocks, they are ineligible to squat. Squatting
  removes the squatter from the lottery, and immediately assigns
  the squatter their current assignment - once a squat is
  declared it cannot be undone. Squats can be declared up to the
  moment that another resident has selected to room in question,
  although it is encouraged to declare them as soon as possible
  to alleviate stress. Students assigned to their rooms by RACs
  are ineligible to squat - this includes all freshmen, transfer
  students, and residents who have been redistributed by the
  building waitlist. Furthermore, people who have swapped rooms
  since the last Spring Lottery cannot squat their rooms. Any
  official lottery-based room changes are eligible for
  squatting.</p>
